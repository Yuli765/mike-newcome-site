        <p>November 13th Launch Speech — Refined DraftIn thinking about today’s announcement, I couldn’t help but be reminded of an experience my son Maxwell had last June. He was chosen to give the class speech at his Mahtomedi High School graduation.In preparation, he must have practiced that speech a hundred times in front of me — always looking for feedback. Each time, I’d remind him: make eye contact, stand up straight, and slow down — because, as anyone who knows a Newcome can tell you, we tend to talk fast.When the day finally came, he stepped up to that microphone, looked out at the crowd, and with the confidence of someone who belonged there, said, “Let’s do this!”So, in honor of my son Maxwell… let’s do this!We are here today because our political and governance system in Minnesota is broken.It’s no longer by the people, for the people — it’s by the party and special interests, for the party and special interests.I like to call it the political Matrix.We think we’re in control, but in reality, we’re powering the machine — and the machine serves only itself.Now, I don’t blame the people who are stuck inside that Matrix. It’s a comfortable and familiar place to be, especially when your friends and family are right there with you.But today, we’re offering freedom from that political Matrix — and showing that there’s a better way.A way rooted in common sense.This campaign will focus on real issues that affect real Minnesotans.It will be about inspiring people, not scaring them.We’re going to welcome those who want a better way of governing — not those looking to fight an “enemy” created by the political Matrix.If you need to describe your opponent with a pejorative, that should be an automatic disqualification for public service.And it should also tell you something: you’ve got nothing to run on except fear.Over the next twelve months, we’ll be talking with Minnesotans about real issues — and with a little Minnesota common sense, we might actually accomplish something if people give us the chance.We don’t have all the answers, and we’re not going to make empty promises.The only promise I’ll make is this: this will be a positive campaign — one that focuses on solutions, not blame.This is about our future, not our past.It’s time to move forward.In business, we always have a mission statement — a simple declaration of who we are and what we stand for.So here’s the Newcome for Governor 2026 Mission Statement:Safety and Opportunity for All.Every Minnesotan should have equal access to the “good life” — if they’re willing to work for it.That good life starts with being safe in your home, on your street, in your community, and in our beautiful Twin Cities.And it extends to our children — who deserve to feel safe in their schools.World-Class Education.No matter your zip code, every child deserves a world-class education that prepares them for whatever future they choose.Let’s get adult agendas out of our schools and let teachers teach.Common Sense Government.Our state agencies and the Minnesotans that work in them should be empowered to make commonsense decisions for Minnesotans — not for political parties or special interests.The political Matrix and its influence will be a thing of the past.Protecting Our Land and Water.Our soil will stay fertile and our waters clean — so future generations can live the Minnesota dream and enjoy the great outdoors we all cherish.Leadership You Don’t Have to Think About.Minnesotans should be talking about the weather and our sports teams — not worrying about our political leaders, including the governor.When we do hear from them, it shouldn’t be doom and gloom — it should be about possibility, unity, and progress.This campaign is about bringing Minnesota together — one commonsense conversation at a time.We can’t fix the political Matrix overnight, but together, we can build something better.We can restore trust.We can restore hope.And we can remind people that government exists to serve them — not the other way around.So again, in the words of my son Maxwell…Let’s do this.</p>
